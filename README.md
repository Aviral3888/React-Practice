This is a repo for practicing and maintaining React Learnings and Practices.

### React-app : create-react-app
npx create-react-app my-app
- Gives Boilerplate code for starting with react, saving a lot of developer time.
- Brings all the required files and even installs it into node_modules.
- Serves the components as a bundle during development mode.


### React-app : vite 
npm create vite@latest
- supports other frameworks as well, for eg: Vanilla, Vue, Svelte, React, Preact etc.
- Only brings the file but doesn't install it directly, needs to done afterwards.
